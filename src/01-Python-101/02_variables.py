# Rules for Python Variables
# - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
# - A variable name cannot start with a number
# - A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
# - Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
